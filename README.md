# Course Overview

We will cover below topics in this course

1. Local State
    * When we are talking about **Local State** we are talking about the state of one widget or perhaps one widget and one widget next to it.
    * In this module we will cover below topics:
        a. Stateless Widgets
        b. Stateful Widgets
2. Shared State
    * When we are talking about sharing state over a larger depth of you application. For Example:
      * Passing state from your application level down four or more levels in the tree.
    * We are talking about two primary concepts:
    a. ScopedModel
    b. Provider
3. Separating UI and Logic
   * It's a very common when you are creating UI to have some business logic creep in, so in this module, we will talk about how that can happen, and we talk about strategies that we have available to us to enforce a clean *separation* of your **user interface** and that **business logic**
   * In this module we will cover:
    a. Streams
    b. BLoCs (Business Logic Components)
