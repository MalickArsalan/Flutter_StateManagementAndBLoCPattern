**Note**:

* Providder have lots of benifits
* We only cover the mechanics of provifers, hoe to apply. But will not explore all the benefits.

So our goal is same:

* We got user preference, ee got this state at the top of our application, at the top of widget tree,
* And we want to pass some piece of that state down into a lower-level component.

How to achieve this using **Providers**:

* Very similar to **ScopedModel** we define a model to find external to the application.
* Then inside our main function, this could be the *top level widget*, but in this case we, we are going to use main function, we are going to intantiate a **ChangeNotifierProvider**.
* **Note**: ChangeNotifierProvider is a type of provider that automatically handles **change notification** for us.
* Then we are going to pass in a create function, and then create function is going to instantiate our **UserPrefsModel** and make it available this to entire widget tree.
* Then we are going to specify the child. In our case the entire application is our childof this provider.
* Then in our **ImageGallery**, we are going to get access to that **UserOrefsModel** by using **BuildContext**
