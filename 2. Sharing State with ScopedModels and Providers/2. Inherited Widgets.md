# Inherited Widget

![Inherited Widget](2.1.%20Inherited%20Widget.png)

* So we have our model here, our goal. We have **UserPrefs** state up at the **App Level** and we want to get that down to the *ImageGalery* without communicating directly with intermediate pages. So how we can achieve this with **Inherited Widgets**

* If we look at this above architecture from a slightly different prospective.

* We have App Level(App), ImageGalleryPage and ImageGallery.
* Within our app, we create an InheritedWidget.
* That InheritedWidget contain the UserPreferencesModel. that contain the state and the behaviours that allow us to manipulate that state.
* What we are going to do, we use **BuildContext**, the parameter we receive inside our **build** method.
* We are going to use the **BuildContext** to communicate the model directly from *Inherited Widget* down to *ImageGallery*.
