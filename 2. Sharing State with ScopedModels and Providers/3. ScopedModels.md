# Scoped Model

![Scoped Model](3.1.%20Scoped%20Model.png)

In **Scoped Model** we have slightly different approach than we had with **Inherited Widget**. With Scoped Model We are going to:

* Start by defining the model, and that is going to be widget tree. For this case we have got our **UserPreferenceModel**, and it got **itemsPerPage** property that we want to get access to propagate through the application down into that gallery page.
* Than we got the **App Widget** and within that App Widget, we are going to build a widget called a **ScopedModel** model.
Inside the ScopedModel, we are going to provide the UserPreferenceModel, as well as child page, in this case, the ImageGalleryPage child.
* Inside our *Widget Tree*, when we have a widget that is interested in getting access to that **ScopedModel**, than we are going to use **ScopedModelDescendant** class to get the *access*.
* So inside **ScopedModelDescendant**, we will add **ImageGallery**, and then we are going to inject **UserPreferenceModel** using ScopedModelDescendant.

**Note**: Very Similar approach to **Inherited Widget**, but slightly different because we are not using the build context, we are using ScopedModelDescendant.
