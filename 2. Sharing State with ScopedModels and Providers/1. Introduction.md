# Sharing State with ScopedModels and Providers

Just imagine that our application looks like this. We got an App, inside we have got two pages, an ImageGallery and TagPage. Inside of the ImageGalleryPage we've got a couple of widgets, and inside of the TagPage we've got a list of those tags.

The idea of sharing state is we have got some state higher up in our **widget tree**.

**Example:** May be we got some user preferences at our app level. What we are going to do is get one of those properties down into the ImageGallery, down into one of our descendent widgets. So the question is that how do we do that?

* Well using **Stateful Widgets,** we have to pass that state information down every level of the tree. This is approach sometimes make sense, but often it make those intermediate widget kind of *cluttered* because now they are receiving this information just for the purpose of passing it along.

* Instead of above approach we share that state directly where it's' needed.

 This mechanism is called **Shared State**. So user preferences data sitting at the app level, What we like to do is pull the user preferences down into that **ImageGallery** and expose the **ItemsPerPage** property right there. So we skip **ImageGallery Page**. So ideally we have got **bidirectional** communication where we can read the **ItemsPerPage** property and, if necessary, we would update that **ItemsPerPage** state at **ImageGallery** level and have it take effect at the app level where the state is being stored.
